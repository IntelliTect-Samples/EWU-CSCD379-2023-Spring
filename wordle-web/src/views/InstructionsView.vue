                    The Good Word is a guessing game where the goal of the game is to guess
                    a randomly selected 5 letter word. You can use a keyboard to type, or you
                    can use the interactive keyboard on the screen to click buttons. You get a
                    total of 6 guesses in order to find the correct word. If a letter guessed
                    is correct then it will change colors to GREEN, if a letter guessed is 
                    correct but in the wrong location it will change colors to YELLOW, if a letter 
                    guessed is incorrect it will change colors to RED. After guessing the correct
                    word or after guessing incorrectly 6 times the game will end and your score will be
                    recorded and saved. Are you ready to start guessing?

                    Wildcards and the Valid-Guesses tool are designed to help you solve the correct word.

                    The Valid-Guesses tool is used to help you find valid words based on the letters
                    that are input. Once one or more letters are input into a guess, you can click the
                    valid guesses bar. The valid guesses bar will then display all the possible valid words
                    based off of the letters that were input. If you select one of the words it will
                    automatically input it as your guess but it will NOT submit it.

                    Wildcards, otherwise know as a question mark (?), are used to substitute for letters you
                    are uncertain about. For example, if you know the correct location of 3 letters but are 
                    not sure what the last two letters are, you can input a question mark (?) for the two letters
                    thats are uncertain. From there you can use the Valid-Guesses tool in order to determine what
                    the secret word is.
