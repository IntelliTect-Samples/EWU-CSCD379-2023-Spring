      This project was created by an aspiring web developer who is taking a class through Eastern
      Washington University - CSCD379<br />
      The end goal of this project is to create a working version of the classic word game Wordle
      using Vue.js and Vuetify. Along with a few other things to make it interesting.
      <br /><br />
      One of our instructors is Meg, she is a genius software engineer at IntelliTect. Shadowing her
      made me realize I wanted to become a developer! <br />
      The other instructor is Grant, and he is the Chief Technical Officer at IntelliTect.
