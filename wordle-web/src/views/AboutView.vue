    <v-card-text>
      This is the about page of the game we have been working on in
      CSCD 379. Wordle is a popular game by the New York Times.
      A guessing game where you have 6 chances to correctly guess
      a 5 letter word. The game will show when a letter is correct and in the correct spot,
      or the letter is correct just in the wrong spot or just flat out wrong. This
      website is my interpertation of it using the skills taught
      in this class.
