# woodle game ideas:
-A hint system to give a letter hint or a correct position if the player makes no progress in 2-3 tried
-A chaos mode where the letter is backward 
-A message at the end of the game depending on the player's completion of the word. ex: "Congrats", "You're almost there", or "You're not even trying are you?" for 0 correct letters.
