# CSCD Class

## Info
The end result of this repo will be a working version of the word game Wordle.

### Updates
- <b> 4/6/23 </b> Template Vue site deployed through Azure.
- <b> 4/9/23 </b> gameView.vue page was added

## Assignment 1
- Site URL: https://thankful-island-092b59a1e.3.azurestaticapps.net/
- New page created called gameView.vue cause the system didn't like a single word name as assignment had originally requested.


#### Extra Credit Opportunity 
- Have level options (easy, medium, hard) which have a different word bank each of with more common words in easy mode and less common words in hard mode
- Have different themes the user can choose from that change the color of the letters and the background color
- Have animations. Like the title at the top of the game does a continuous wave/bounce thing
- Have a funny message pop up on the side that depends on their guess and how many things are right.
