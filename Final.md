# Final
Build a full stack web application.
You can work in groups of 1-4 people, larger groups will need instructor approval
You can start working on this project as soon or as late as you want. The due date will be when the class final is held, students will come in and present their application to the class on finals day.

On the last day of class (June 8th) we will have an in class hackathon for students to come in and work on their project. On this day the instructors will be avaliable for helping with questions and collaborating with students to solve any issues or bugs.

## Requirments
- Must use Vue/Vuetify/Typescript front end
- Must use ASP.NET back end
- Must use a SQL database with Entity Framework

## How to obtain the full 50 points for the assignment
- Meet all of the above requirments
- The application should do something midly interisting, (e.g. it should probably do something more than just displaying a weather report)

## How to obtain the 50 points of extra credit
- These points are given out at the instructors discretion
- It will be very difficult to obtain all 50 points, but if you go beyond the basic criteria it should not be difficult to obtain partial points
- Some ways you may be able to obtain extra credit (doing multiple of these options will get you closer to 50 points)
  - Implement auth (e.g. some kind of login system)
  - Do something with SignalR (e.g. two way chat app)
  - Write an interisting or complex algorithm (e.g. suggesting similar products or reccommendations on an E-Commerce site)
  - Include complex animations (e.g. a video game in the browser, player driven character animations)
  - Use CI/CD pipelins and deploy your app to Azure

## Some ideas!
- Note Taking App
    - Users can take notes
    - Maybe by using a WYSIWYG editor? 
    - Users can see past notes, new notes, delete notes, etc. 
    - Users can create an account
- Receipe Keeper App 
    - Users can save recipies either from the web or ones they write themselves. 
    - Maybe the API parases out web pages with receipies on them and saves those recipies automatically for the user
    - The user can save a photo of the food
    - The user can rate recipies or add tags to them
    - Users can create an account
    - Users can share recipies with other users
- Quiz App
    - The user can make quizzes that are saved to the database
    - Other users can take the quiz, their scores can be saved and a leaderboard can be shown
    - Users can create an account and see their quiz history
    - Users can be suggested new quizzes
    - The quiz app can shuffle the questions order
- Fake E-Commerce store
    - User can view products and add them to a cart
    - Users can log in to save their cart details
    - Users can checkout with their cart (maybe don't put any credit card information here. :) )
    - The site can suggest simmilar products to the user
    - The site keeps track of the invitory and alerts a user when an item is out of stock
- Real time chat app
    - The user can chat with other users in a chat session
    - Users can make an account
    - Users can see their chat history 
    - Emojis are supported
    - Users can react to messages (e.g. like, dislike, heart) others messages
    - The application is secure, only the users in the chat session can see eachothers messages
    - Users can send images, videos, likes, etc that get rendered in the chat
