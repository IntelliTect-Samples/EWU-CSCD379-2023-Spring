- Create unit tests for the validWords method ❌✅
- Display the number of valid words based on the entered letters ❌✅
- When the number is clicked, show a dialog with all the available words with scrolling if there are too many to show on the screen. ❌✅
- When a word is clicked, the word should be entered as the guess but not submitted ❌✅
- Add a hover over for the word so it is obvious that it can be clicked. (No CSS) ❌✅

2. Convert the sidebar to an App Bar ❌✅
